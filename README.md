PhantomCrawler allows users to simulate website interactions through different proxy IP addresses. It leverages Python, requests, and BeautifulSoup to offer a simple and effective way to test website behaviour under varied proxy configurations.

**Features:**
- Utilizes a list of proxy IP addresses from a specified file.
- Supports both HTTP and HTTPS proxies.
- Allows users to input the target website URL, proxy file path, and a static port.
- Makes HTTP requests to the specified website using each proxy.
- Parses HTML content to extract and visit links on the webpage.

**Usage:**
- **POC Testing:** Simulate website interactions to assess functionality under different proxy setups.
- **Web Traffic Increase:** Boost website hits by generating requests from multiple proxy IPs.
- **Proxy Rotation Testing:** Evaluate the effectiveness of rotating proxy IPs.
- **Web Scraping Testing:** Assess web scraping tasks under different proxy configurations.
- **DDoS Awareness:** Caution: The tool has the potential for misuse as a DDoS tool. Ensure responsible and ethical use.

⚠️ **Get New Proxies** with port and add in `proxies.txt` in this format `50.168.163.176:80`

- You can add it from here: https://free-proxy-list.net/ these free proxies are not validated some might not work so first validate these proxies before adding.
